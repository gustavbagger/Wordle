# Wordle

If you want full access, download the entire project and run the shell script _wordle.sh_. If you want to use a different library to the default one, input the filepath to said library when prompted.

If you want to try the programme without downloading the entire functionality, do the following:
1) Download the files in folder _quickstart_
2) Run the python file in python3
3) When prompted, input the filepath to the library provided. Likely this will be

`./valid_wordle_words.txt`

unless you moved the files after downloading them. If this fails, change the last line of the python file to 

`wordle() ./valid_wordle_words.txt`

and run the file again.
